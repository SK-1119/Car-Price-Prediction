# Car-Price-Prediction
This is a project that Predicts the price of any car Based on the past trends 
provided to the machine by the Massive data we have downloaded from open sources available on the internet
I recommend you to clone the whole Repository rather than any single file for smooth workflow

After cloning you can simply run the Car Prediction script
it accesses the joblib files that are provided to the program included in the joblib folder

you can also create your own joblib files by running the clean.py script
also you can change the values for svm and linear regression model for alterations 


Note:- This can also affect the accuracy of the model so do it wisely


for the smooth workflow the r2score (for accuracy) is printed after every change run in the model 
So that you can Alter it according to the available hardware

more capable hardware can handle higher values of attributes for svm which can increase accuracy
